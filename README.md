# Analog-Filter-Design
This repository contains SPICE implementation and simulation of several Analog filters studied in the course Analog Filter Design,
 ECD07, NSIT, by Prof. Raj Senani.

## Please find detaied experiment report in project specific README.md. 
### NOTE: Experiments before these were hardware experiments that were performed in LAB and those are not documented here. 

# OVERVIEW

# EXP 7: Current-mode biquad using a current conveyor (CC II+)
**1. Verify that the circuit shown in Figure 2 realizes a low pass, bandpass and high pass**
    **filter as follows:**  
       **a. Low pass: i1 = i3 = 0, i2 = iin**  
       **b. Band pass: i1 = i2 =0, i3 = iin**  
       **c. High pass: i1 = -i2 and i3 = i1(R1/R2)(1 + C2/C1)  
2. Discuss Limitations of the circuit  
3. Comment upon if this is the only single CCII/single CFOA circuit which can realise**  
    **an Universal filter?  
4. Find out by searching the literature if there is any similar circuit known which can**. 
    **realise universal filter using a single CCII/CFOA in voltage mode i.e inputs and**  
    **output both being voltages rather than currents?**
